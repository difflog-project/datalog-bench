# Datalog Benchmarks & Rule Generation Code

### Benchmark Structure
Note that each benchmark may not contain all files listed below.

Additionally, a few benchmarks (*quickfoil-webkb* and *quickfoil-bongard*) contain variants: 
<br>
&emsp;*quickfoil-webkb* has 8 variants which are generated from different data sources but have similar size candidate rule sets.
<br>
&emsp;*quickfoil-bongard* has 10 variants which are generated from the same data source but have varying size candidate rule sets.

### Files specific to ALPS format
<b>\*.d</b> -- ALPS-friendly input and output data. There should be one .d file per benchmark.
<br>
<b>\*.tp</b> -- ALPS-friendly template file. Contains meta-rules required for ALPS's rule generation. There should be one .tp file per benchmark.
<br>

### Files specific to ProSynth format
<b>\*.facts</b> -- ProSynth-friendly input data. Contains expected tuples for a specific input. There should be one .facts file per input relation. 
<br>
<b>\*.expected</b> -- ProSynth-friendly output data. Contains expected tuples for a specific output. There should be one .expected file per output relation. 
<br>
<b>rules.t</b> -- ProSynth-friendly template file. Defines input and output relations for ProSynth's brute force candidate rule generation algorithm. There should be one rules.t file per benchmark.
<br>
<b>rules.small.dl</b> -- ProSynth-friendly candidate rules set sourced from ALPS's rule generation algorithm and converted to ProSynth format. There should be one rules.small.dl file per benchmark.
<br>
<b>rules.large.dl</b> -- ProSynth-friendly candidate rules set generated by ProSynth's brute force candidate rule generation algorithm (using the provided rules.t file). There should be one rules.large.dl file per benchmark. Note that rules.large.dl usually contains between 2 - 10 times the number of candidate rules as rules.small.dl. 
<br>
<b>rules_notexists.\*.dl</b> -- ProSynth-friendly auxillary rule set used to generate coprovenance - note that these rules are not candidate rules. Created automatically by ProSynth's candidate rule generation algorithm when generating the candidate rule set. There should be at most one rules_notexists.small.dl and at most one rules_notexists.large.dl file per benchmark - these respectively correspond with rules.small.dl and rules.large.dl.
<br>
<b>rules_exists.\*.dl</b> -- ProSynth-friendly auxillary rule set used to generate allprovenance - note that these rules are not candidate rules. Created automatically by ProSynth's candidate rule generation algorithm when generating the candidate rule set. There should be at most one rules_exists.small.dl and at most one rules_exists.large.dl file per benchmark - these respectively correspond with rules.small.dl and rules.large.dl.
<br>
<b>ruleNames.\*.txt</b> -- ProSynth-friendly list of rule numbers which define the candidate rules ProSynth has access to. By default, this is a list of rule numbers for all candidate rules.  Created automatically by ProSynth's candidate rule generation algorithm when generating the candidate rule set. There should be at most one ruleNames.small.txt and at most one ruleNames.large.txt file per benchmark - these respectively correspond with ruleNames.small.txt and ruleNames.large.txt.
